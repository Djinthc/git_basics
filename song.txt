You knew me better than anyone ever
And I remember your very first letter
We were so young and all that we wanted was more
We fit each other like rebels on Harleys
And I knew how to answer your body
But at the speed that we drove we were bound to wash out

We flew rockets to the sun
Knowing we'd crash and burn
And that's the risk we run
When you fall in love


I could read every word you were thinking
You gave me something I never was given
It was heaven and hell all at once as we laughed and cried
There always needs to be one that is willing
To throw a rope down to someone who's slipping
But sometimes you gotta know when to let it go
